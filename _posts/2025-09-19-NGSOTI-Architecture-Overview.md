# NGSOTI – Architecture Overview

The **[Next Generation SOC Training Infrastructure (NGSOTI)](https://github.com/ngsoti/)** project is an open-source initiative to build realistic, reproducible SOC environments for training and education. It integrates mature open-source components with **ReST APIs and OpenAPI specifications** to ensure interoperability, scalability, and extensibility. 

This document aims to present a comprehensive overview of the NGSOTI architecture while also reflecting on the insights, feedback, and experience gained during the initial phase of the project.

## Scope

The NGSOTI project is designed to replicate the day-to-day environment of a modern Security Operations Center (SOC) and provide trainees with the essential skills required to operate effectively in such settings. To achieve this, the training infrastructure must cover the core requirements of SOC analysts and incident responders:

- **Log Management and Analysis**
SOC analysts must be able to collect, normalise, store, and query large volumes of heterogeneous logs (endpoint, network, application, cloud). Training scenarios need to expose students to real log pipelines, from raw ingestion to search and correlation.

- **False-Positive Handling and Triage**
Analysts must learn to distinguish between benign anomalies and true security incidents. Training must include workflows for alert triage, suppression of recurring false positives, and case escalation.

- **Detection Engineering**  
  SOC teams are not only consumers of alerts but also creators of new detection rules. Training requires environments where students can experiment with creating, testing, and deploying new signatures, queries, or behavioural detections across different telemetry sources.

- **Information Sharing and Collaboration**  
  Modern SOCs rarely work in isolation. They rely on information exchange with other teams and communities. Exercises must therefore include mechanisms for sharing Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), and incident reports in structured formats.

- **Threat Intelligence Integration**  
  To contextualise alerts and drive better decision-making, analysts need access to threat intelligence feeds and vulnerability information. Training environments must integrate open-source threat intelligence platforms (e.g., MISP) and vulnerability knowledge bases (e.g., Vulnerability-Lookup) to provide authentic enrichment and prioritisation workflows.

By embedding these requirements into the training scope, NGSOTI ensures that students are not only exposed to realistic datasets and tools, but also to the **operational processes and analytical workflows** that define real-world SOC operations. This explains the architectural choices described in the following sections.

## Purpose of the Architecture

NGSOTI addresses key challenges in SOC training:

- **Infrastructure Access**: Many training centers/universities lack resources to simulate SOC environments.  
- **Integration with Modern Tooling**: SOC tools evolve quickly; training must adapt.  
- **Reusable Exercises**: Scenarios must be standardised (via **[CEXF](https://github.com/MISP/cexf)**) for replay and sharing.  
- **Accessible Datasets**: Trainees should work with **realistic telemetry and dataset** from real-world sources.

# Component Details

It is important to note that the components described in this section represent the **current set of integrated tools**, but the architecture is not limited to these specific projects. The NGSOTI stack is intentionally designed to be **modular and extensible**, making it possible to replace, extend, or complement components as new tools and technologies emerge. This means that future iterations of the architecture document can evolve to incorporate additional open-source projects, new detection capabilities, or alternative analyst platforms, while still adhering to the same design principles of interoperability, open standards, and reproducibility.

# Example End-to-End Data Flow

The architecture has been **designed and validated using real scenario flows**, as outlined in the exercise workflow section. By mapping each component of the stack to the practical steps of a training exercise, from scenario creation in SkillAegis, through real-data detection and enrichment in Tenzir and MISP, to case handling in FlowIntel, we ensured that the system is not only conceptually sound but also operationally effective. This validation process demonstrated that the architecture can support realistic SOC analyst activities, such as log analysis, detection engineering, triage, and intelligence-driven decision making, thereby confirming its suitability for real-world training environments including the infrastructure from private training centers or University such as the University of Luxembourg or University of Lorraine.

## Sample exercise workflow

1. Instructor creates an exercise in **SkillAegis** (CEXF).  
2. Trainee actions generate detection from **Kunai, Zeek, Suricata, Sysmon**.  
3. **Tenzir** collects → normalises → enriches with **MISP** and **Vulnerability-Lookup** → filters via **Poppy**.  
4. Alerts appear in **Wazuh dashboards**, all data archived in **object storage**.  
5. Confirmed alerts create cases in **FlowIntel**; scoreboard updated in SkillAegis.  
6. Continuous enrichment: **AIL, Lookyloo, Pandora** feed into **MISP**.  
7. **Cerebrate** synchronises intelligence and exercises across training centers.  

## Additional Exercise Workflow: ISAC Intelligence to SOC Action

1. **Intelligence Ingestion**  
   An **ISAC** shares a new MISP event containing indicators related to an active campaign. The event is automatically synchronised into the training environment’s **MISP instance** through federation.

2. **Exercise Setup**  
   The instructor assigns the scenario in **SkillAegis**, which provides the trainee with access to the relevant MISP event, including IOCs (domains, hashes, IP addresses) and contextual information (threat actor, campaign, TTPs).

3. **Detection and Correlation**  
   The trainee must configure detection rules in **Tenzir**, **Suricata**, or **Zeek** to monitor lab telemetry for signs of the shared indicators. This step requires hands-on **detection engineering** to ensure that the SOC tooling reacts to the threat intelligence feed.

4. **Analysis and Case Handling**  
   If matches are found in the telemetry, alerts are generated and forwarded to **FlowIntel**. The trainee is responsible for triaging the case, reviewing logs, and validating whether the activity represents malicious behaviour or false positives.

5. **Outcome Resharing**  
   Once the analysis is complete, the trainee must **update the original MISP event** with additional findings (new IOCs, sightings, correlations) and **reshare the enriched event** back into the ISAC community. This tests the **information sharing and collaboration process** in SOC operations.

6. **Feedback and Scoring**  
   **SkillAegis** retrieves case outcomes and event updates to calculate scores based on the quality of detections, accuracy of analysis, and completeness of the information shared back to the community.


# Conclusion

The NGSOTI architecture is not intended as a rigid, one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, it is designed as a set of **building blocks** that can be assembled, adapted, or selectively deployed depending on the needs of a training center, university, or SOC exercise. Each component, from telemetry sensors to case management platforms,exposes documented ReST APIs and adheres to open standards, ensuring interoperability and reusability across diverse environments, including challenging training setups with rigid constraints or limited access to network services.


This modularity allows training organizers to **cherry-pick the tools** that best match their objectives. For example, one exercise may focus primarily on network traffic analysis, relying heavily on Zeek and Suricata, while another may emphasize case management and collaboration, making greater use of FlowIntel and MISP. By decoupling the layers, the architecture supports both minimal deployments for lightweight scenarios and full-stack deployments for end-to-end SOC simulations.

Another advantage of this approach is **progressive adoption**. Institutions that may initially lack the infrastructure or expertise to run a full SOC stack can start small, integrating just a subset of components. Over time, they can expand their setup by adding new datasets, enrichment modules, or analyst tooling, without having to rebuild the entire environment. This incremental path lowers the entry barrier and fosters long-term sustainability.

Equally important, the use of **open-source projects** ensures that the tools are transparent, extensible, and supported by active communities. Trainers and students alike benefit from engaging with widely adopted platforms such as MISP, Tenzir, and Suricata, gaining skills directly transferable to professional SOC environments. At the same time, the open ecosystem allows contributors to extend functionalities and share improvements, creating a virtuous feedback loop.

In summary, the NGSOTI architecture provides a **flexible foundation for SOC training**. It offers a common framework that can be tailored to diverse requirements, encourages reuse of scenarios and data, and lowers the barriers to creating authentic training environments. Whether deployed in its entirety or in parts, NGSOTI empowers institutions to deliver realistic, modern, and effective SOC training experiences.
