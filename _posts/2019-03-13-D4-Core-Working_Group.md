# What

D4 Project is building a large-scale distributed sensor network to monitor DDoS
and other malicious activities relying on an open and collaborative project.

Building a large-scale network sensor can be a tedious task, the aim of the D4
Project is to make the creation and maintenance of such network simple and
efficient. To reach the goal, the D4 project will develop open source components
required to operate such network sensor and will live test the infrastructure
with an DDoS and malicious activities sensor network deployed on a voluntary
basis.

Representatives of the following organizations are encouraged to participate in the
project and invited to join this workshop:

 - CERT.LU members
 - National CSIRTs
 - Governmental CSIRTs
 - TF-CSIRT members
 - FIRST members
 - CSIRTs at large
