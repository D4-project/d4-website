# What

The D4 Core Working Group meeting was organized at CIRCL/SMILE premises on
March 29 2019. The purpose of the meeting was to show the progress of the
ongoing activities in the D4 projects followed by technical challenges.

The meeting was composed of people from Governmental CSIRTs, national CSIRTs,
CSIRTs for National and Research and Education Networks, private CSIRTS from
the banking sector, ministry of defence and economy, MISP core developers
and AIL developers.

The audience benefited from a practical demonstration of developed d4 software
on life data streams and a set of presentation materials which were also
[published] (https://github.com/D4-project/architecture/tree/master/docs/workshop)
In addition to the preliminary agenda, the use case of passive SSL was
presented which acts as solid IP validation building block within the
d4 project.

The expert discussion session in the afternoon was quite fruitful. A lot
of interesting questions and topics were debated
leading to new requirements for the components of the d4 project.
These requirements were analysed and led to requests for
existing and new d4 software components. These requests were
published on github on the repositories such as on the
[architecture] repository (https://github.com/D4-project/architecture/issues)
and the [analyzer-d4-pibs]  repository (https://github.com/D4-project/analyzer-d4-pibs/issues)

The issues are tagged with the label "topic:coreworkinggroup" such that the
interested parties can track the evolution of their requests.
