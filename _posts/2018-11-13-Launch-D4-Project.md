# Launch of the D4 project

The D4 project was presented at the Luxembourg Internet days 2018 at Chamber of
commerce by GÃ©rard Wagener the 13th November 2018. He did a small presentation
about the motivation of the D4 project especially on the incident response
aspects during denial of service attacks. He presented various observed
denial of attacks with the challenges during incident response such as
the evaluation of denial of service blackmails, commercial denial of service
services on the underground market and politically oriented denial of service
attacks.

The goal of the D4 project is to have a constant reliable view on ongoing
denial of service attacks and capacities delivered by distributed
denial of service detection devices that are developed during this project.

The D4 project is raised from the CIRCL honeybot research program and the
speaker showed some practical examples to measure denial of service attack
capacities with honeypots and blackhole networks acting as proof of concept
for the denial of service detection devices.

The d4 project includes the following activities

- Development of the DDoS detection platform
    * Deployment of distributed DOS detection devices on voluntary basis
- Open D4 core working setup
 * Discussions about DDOS strategies, effectiveness of mitigation techniques and more
- Provide open data sets
- Provision and advisory support services
    * Extension of CIRCL services (AIL, DMA)
- Training courses
