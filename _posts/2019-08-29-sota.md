Denial of Service attacks are attacks where an attacker aims at preventing a
service to answer to its legitimate users. There are numerous ways of performing
such attacks, one of the most prevalent one is by causing resources exhaustion
on the infrastructure furnishing the service. This can be done by flooding a
server with requests: the server cannot keep up with the rate of request and
legitimate users are denied to access the service. It can be figured naively as
an arm wrestling situation where the side with the higher bandwidth wins.

But DoS activities can not be reduced to this naive one to one approach:
attackers seek to be efficient and achieve their goal while using the minimum
amount of bandwidth possible. Therefore DoS operations become distributed
(D-DoS) and by combining others techniques like amplification, manage to become
sustainable businesses <sup id="bb9dce372c5d60631c6ecaf9d47a8453"><a href="#kq418" title="Oleg Kupreev, DDoS Attacks in Q4 2018, v(), (2019).">kq418</a></sup>.

This article is part of set in which we discuss the state of the art of DDoS. In
this article, we introduce remote Denial of Service attacks' techniques as well
as basics characteristics, regardless of the network protocols involved. We
discuss how an attacker set up an attack, the side effect of each steps, and
where D4 could be used to detect DDoS-related activities without sitting on the
targeted infrastructure.

This series of article is a rolling release or a knowledge base: we plan to
discuss several topics around DDoS detection, the literature around these, and
what could be implemented in D4. Some parts will back up the inception of D4
analyzers, others will explain why we prefer not follow specific paths.


# Background

In the following section, we present different concepts that are useful to
discuss DDoS, what are the side effects of attacker's activities, and how D4
could be used to detect these.


## The TCP/IP model

The TCP/IP model is a layered model for computer communication. There are 4
layers, that pass data to the layer above and receive data from the layer below.
Layers are organized in the following way:

<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

## MITRE ATT&CK

MITRE ATT&CK framework <sup id="72354778e85faf12f5bfc5b42a6bc9b5"><a href="#2018mitre" title="Strom, Applebaum, Miller, Nickels, Pennington \&amp; Thomas, MITRE ATT\&amp;CK&#8482;: Design and philosophy, v(), (2018).">2018mitre</a></sup> contains two techniques to describe DoS attacks:

-   Network Denial of Service ([T1498](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498)): Adversaries may perform Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of targeted resources to users. Network DoS can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on. Example resources include specific websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting network DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion.
-   Endpoint Denial of Service ([T1499](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499)): Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion.


## Naive DoS Attacks

The basic naive approach we use in introduction can be pictured as basic
flooding: an attacker sends numerous requests to a service, while spoofing
source IP to disguise his, until the server's resources are depleted and
further requests can not be answered.

These naive DoS attacks can arise across all layers. This is the most
expensive, way of disrupting a service as the attacker is the origin of all the
requests. Still, as client/server communications are usually asymmetric (client
receive bigger response than the requests it sent), the attacker does not need
the same amount of resources as the target to disrupt the service. Therefore
this kind of attack are mostly Endpoint Denial of Service techniques types.


## Getting Smarter: Distributed Attacks

The distribution of a DoS attack is usually done via the use of 'Bots': machines
that were infected by a malware that creates a master-slave relationship between
the attacker and the machines (the botnet). After infection, the attacker can
send commands to its bots to order to attack a target, as pictured below.

![img](/assets/images/many2one.svg)

DDoS usually arise on OSI layers 2/3 and aims at clogging the network between the
target and its clients by generating a lot of network traffic. These are Network
Denial of Service attacks.


## Getting Smarter: Amplification in DDoS

Another technique to lower even more the resources spent by the attacker to
disrupt a service is amplification: the attacker sends small spoofed queries to
a third-party service that triggers large responses directed at the target.

![img](/assets/images/amplification.svg)

Amplification attacks usually arise on layers 2/3 and are therefore Network
Denial of Service attacks.


## Getting Smarter: Exploiting the protocol

The last technique an attacker can rely on to disrupt a service is to exploit
protocol loopholes that allow requests to trigger expensive processing. By
sending malformed packets, incomplete requests, or requests that take forever to
receive, the attacker can push the target to spend more resources on a request
than is usually needed.

These kind of attack focus on the application layer and are therefore
Endpoint Denial of Service attacks.


# Attacker's journey and its side-effects

Instead of digging straight in details into every kind of DDoS attacks we will
now focus on the attackers' behaviours prior and during the attack, and the
corresponding side-effects we reckon we can observe on the network.

The first step an attacker has to go through even before attempting an attack is
to create the capability to perform it. MITRE PRE-ATT&CK framework
<sup id="988774c674ef8af1e74d67e45a21b739"><a href="#preattack" title="MITRE ATT\&amp;CKB, MITRE PRE-ATT\&amp;CK&#8482;, v(), (2018).">preattack</a></sup> describes several step that an attacker may go through at this
point. We could transpose DDoS capacity building in this setting as follows:

-   **Build capability** ([TA0024](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0024)): The attacker first needs the required software and know-how to perform the attacker. This step may not produce any easily observable side effect as it can be developed in a contained environment.
-   **Stage capability** ([TA0026](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0026)): The attacker build the operational environment for his attack. This step appears more promising as it may involve scanning the Internet to find reflectors, creating a botnet, etc.
-   **Test capability** ([TA0025](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0025)): The attacker ensures that the capability is working as intended by launching his DDoS capability against a dedicated infrastructure.

Note that PRE-ATT&CK also contain a Booter Technique ([T1396](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1396)) in which most of
this setup phase is taken care of by a third party, and the attack ready to
perform. If one were tasked with the duty to detect DDoS attacks, a first step
could be to monitor Booter/stresser services, or setup a fake DDoS service to
inquire about who is interested into this type of services.

Moving on to the staging phase, one could deploy honeypots to listen to incoming
to scanning from the attacker. Listening passively already leak the attacker's
intention, responding actively allows for being part of forthcoming attacks (see
below).

![img](/assets/images/snitchingStaging.svg)

One step further comes purposefully getting infected by the attacker's malware
if the opportunity arises. This would allow for even more interaction with the
attacker as the honeypot would be part of the botnet. But to do so, one as to
reverse engineer the attacker Command and Control protocol.

![img](/assets/images/snitchingStaging2.svg)

After the Staging phase comes Testing. DDoS attackers often use remote services
(eg. <https://dstat.cc/>) to test their capabilities, or capabilities of services
the intend to hire. One strategy could be to set up such service an advertise it
online to pinpoint what DDoS infrastructure are out there, and fingerprint
these.

Once the DDoS is built, comes the operating phase. Again, this phase comes with
side effects that can be monitored to detect DDoS attacks: backscatter traffic.
Backscatter traffic is the traffic that is sent back from the target or other
nodes along the way to the spoofed IP addresses used during the attack. On the
picture below, the Bot randomly picks up a source address in the range of the
monitoring Darknet and allows analysis, furthermore, after the attacks succeeds
the Target is not able to answer but another Network<sub>Node</sub> answers about the
state of the request.

# D4 capabilities

After having described these basics topics around DDoS, we can pinpoint network
activities and corresponding collection locations that are good candidate for
D4.

How hard would it be to be part of these conversations? That is what we will
discuss in the next articles.

Stay tuned.
